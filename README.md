Formal Languages & Finite Automata Homework

Reads non-terminals and production rules from data.in and generates all strings of size less or equal than n.

Format:

NrOfNon-Terminals(number)
Non-Terminal(upper-case letter)
NrOfProductionRules(number)
ProductionRules(upper-case & lower-case letters)

The "epsilon" symbol is represented by the '#' symbol. You can change it from CFG::cuvFinal.

You can read "n" from the cli or send it as an argument.

To do: 

* Clean up the code, get rid of warnings (int->size_t)

* Translate everything in english (sorry)
